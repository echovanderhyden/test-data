In the private sector, consumers can shop, pay bills, and even conduct banking online, and now they?re expecting to conduct government business online in the same way.

Zscaler Private Access builds from the same cloud-based, elastically scalable infrastructure to deliver seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets.\nZscaler Private Access solves the challenges posed by a traditional VPN infrastructure by decoupling your internal assets and applications from the limitations, cost, and complexity of direct IP network connections. Zscaler Private Access delivers seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, the data center, or both. Policy-driven access adjusts dynamically to network changes, enabling enterprise agility while improving user experience.\nWith Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant. Users no longer need to go through a termination appliance in the data center to get to apps in the cloud. In fact, there is no hardware to buy at all, because Zscaler Private Access, like our Cloud Security Platform, functions as a service.\nZscaler maintains all hardware and software, freeing both your IT team and your budget even as we reduce latency and boost scalability. Zscaler Private Access is tied directly to your existing authentication infrastructure, leveraging single sign-on to further reduce complexity. The result is that unlike traditional, network-based remote access solutions, Zscaler Private Access can be deployed in a matter of hours instead of taking weeks or months.\n**Improve your security posture even as you provide seamless access**\nThe reductions in overall cost and complexity are compelling on their own, but the paramount feature of the Zscaler Private Access solution is security. Once a connection is established between the asset and the client, the traffic traversing the solution remains completely isolated; because Zscaler Private Access is built on the premise of zero trust for your private applications, the traffic is isolated from us, as well. And because Zscaler Private Access abstracts the asset from the network, it not only ensures seamless access regardless of physical location, it dramatically increases your overall security posture by effectively making your most sensitive material invisible. Any attempt to route back to the application/asset meets a dead end.\n**Connect by application, not by IP address**\nVPNs have been designed to deliver access to a network, not to an application. Once on a network, malware can propagate and users may be able to get access to adjacent applications from which they should be restricted. In addition, because VPN concentrators must listen for inbound connection attempts, they present an attack surface which may be exploited by such things as Distributed Denial of Service attacks.\nEliminate the cost of VPNs and associated equipment\nAs part of our global, cloud-based security platform, Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, which frees both your IT staff and your budget and enables deployment in a matter of hours. Even better, Zscaler Private Access is deployed via the same Zscaler App you use to access our cloud security platform, which greatly reduces your ?client sprawl? by delivering a\nsingle app that provisions Zscaler Remote Access, Secure Web Gateway, Data Loss Prevention, Cloud Sandboxing, Cloud Firewall, and more.\nTake your applications from ?on-net? to ?dark- net,? at the same time YOU get complete visibility. Zscaler Private Access renders your applications invisible to all but authorized users, and unroutable to anyone. But because the solution works at the application layer, we also deliver a level of visibility to you that has never before been possible. Once you provision a Connector in front of a bank of assets, you can use a wildcard attribute to discover exactly what applications are actually running there. Some customers have found almost ten times as many applications in use as they had expected! And once you know what applications are running, you can easily create granular access rules for them.\nApp Discovery makes deployment easy.","sales_email":"","security_email":"FedRAMP@accenturefederal.com","website":"https://www.accenture.com/us-en/afs-industry-index.aspx","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"F1607067912","name":"18F","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Cloud.gov%20Logo.png","service_offering":"18F Cloud.gov","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":14,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"2016-05-20T04:00:00.000Z","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"2016-08-09T04:00:00.000Z","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2017-02-02T05:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"JAB","fedramp_ready":"2016-05-20T04:00:00.000Z","partnering_agency":"#N/A","fedramp_auth":"2017-02-02T05:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"2022-01-18T05:00:00.000Z","independent_assessor":"#N/A","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Government Community Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","leveraged_systems":[{"id":"F1607067912","csp":"18F","cso":"18F Cloud.gov","status":"FedRAMP Authorized"}],"agency_authorizations":["22-001","22-017-05","Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau","Defense Information Systems Agency","Department of Agriculture","Environmental Protection Agency","Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation","Federal Election Commission","General Services Administration","Internal Revenue Service","National Science Foundation","Office of Personnel Management","United States Agency for International Development","United States Forest Service"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"[Cloud.gov](http://cloud.gov/) is designed and operated by US government workers, for US government work.

Project Hosts also deploys customer dedicated subnets on Azure commercial for those customers/ agencies that request this. The GSS is composed of systems and services that manage access control, authentication, auditing, monitoring, scanning, patching, configuration management, malware prevention, intrusion prevention, incident response, backup, and disaster recovery for each Application deployed on the GSS One- Azure. The GSS One- Azure is classified as a hybrid cloud deployment model to enable state and local agencies as well as commercial entities to deploy applications in a secure environment on top of the GSS One- Azure GSS system.\n\nThere are two main types of customers who use the GSS One- Azure: (i) Independent Software Vendors (ISVs) deploying multitenant SaaS applications and (ii) Federal, state or local agencies and commercial customers deploying dedicated applications just for their agency or organization (not multitenant).  For both types of customers, their applications are deployed on customer-dedicated virtual servers (or Azure PaaS services) inside customer-dedicated subnets.  Network security group access controls ensure that each customer?s subnet is completely isolated from and has no access to any other customer?s subnet.  PaaS security subnets handling functions such as authentication, DMZ, SIEM, etc. are built on Azure Government.  Customers have the option to have their dedicated application subnets built on either Azure Government or Azure Commercial.

Based on the zero-trust principle of least-privileged access, it provides comprehensive security using context-based identity and policy enforcement. Zero Trust Exchange helps agencies achieve the target goals of the Executive Order 14028 and resulting OMB mandates, CISA guidance and directives.\n\nZPA Gov security products are currently utilized by over 100 federal agencies and federal systems integrators today in Zscaler?s US-based FedRAMP Moderate and FedRAMP JAB High approved boundaries in support of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 use case model for FedRAMP approved Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) capabilities. \n\nTIC 3.0 Use Case Examples (Branch Office, Remote Users, and Cloud)\n\nZero-trust VPN alternative: Legacy VPNs fail to deliver the security, visibility, and user experience today?s distributed workforce requires. ZPA delivers fast, direct access to private apps by eliminating VPN traffic backhauling which creates latency, resulting in lost productivity. \n\nSecure Hybrid Workforce:  Users require the ability to move fluidly between their homes, remote locations, branch offices, and headquarters. ZPA enables seamless and secure access to private apps from wherever they need to work, on any device. Local users benefit from an identical experience through an on-prem broker that replicate the policies and controls of the cloud. \n\nThird-party Agentless Access: Third-party agencies, contractors, and vendors require secure, direct access to business applications and OT systems from unmanaged devices. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity from authorized users to named applications without putting third parties on the network. With integrated agentless access, users can access applications from any browser, on any device, without the need to install a client or log into a VPN.\n\nVDI alternative: Traditional VDIs are often slow, unresponsive, and introduce significant costs with racks of servers needed in the data center to support remote access needs. ZPA provides secure, direct connectivity to apps over RDP and SSH, enabling a faster, more secure experience for users. With built-in agentless access through the browser employees and third-party users get seamless secure connectivity from any device without complicated desktop provisioning processes.\n\nSecure workload-to-workload connectivity: Agencies require fast, secure workload-to-workload connectivity across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

More than 2000 of world?s largest organizations in both public and private sector rely on Cofense PhishMe to condition employees to recognize and report phishing attacks.\nOnce certified, Cofense PhishMe will achieve FedRAMP Moderate Authorization, an important milestone meeting the security baselines for more than 300 controls. According to FedRAMP, Moderate Impact Authorization ?is most appropriate for CSOs where the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability would result in serious adverse effects on an agency?s operations, assets, or individuals [?] including significant operational damage to agency assets, financial loss, or individual harm that is not loss of life or physical.? For comparison, solutions achieving FedRAMP Low Authorization are only required to address 125 controls, while organizations obtaining the FedRAMP LI-SaaS Authorization are responsible for just 38 controls.\n**More about Cofense PhishMe**\nThe system enables trained awareness and compliance personnel to run simulated attacks using email templates that look like actual phishing attacks and includes on-the-spot educational content that displays when recipients click on one of the simulated phishing emails.\nFor example, a scenario email might alert recipients that their banking credentials were compromised and ask the recipients to click a link in the email to reset their password. If a recipient does click the link, Cofense PhishMe displays educational content to help that individual recognize the characteristics of a phishing email. Through these safe examples, PhishMe customers can help their employees develop an awareness of the risks that actual phishing emails pose and reduce their susceptibility of engaging with such emails in the future.\nTo maximize the effectiveness of simulation campaigns and reduce the burden on awareness teams, Cofense PhishMe provides a combination of unique capabilities:\n* PhishMe content is based on real phishing attacks gleaned from real threat intelligence.

In fact, security is WordPress VIP?s chief priority. Our data security best practices include end-to-end encryption from edge to origin, resource and data isolation, and encrypted offsite backups. We address physical security through an independently owned and operated network of industry-certified global data centers. Every origin server meets the International Organization of Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001 certification, Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 18 (SOC1) and SOC2 Type 2, and includes ongoing surveillance reviews. At the application level, every instance is protected with Single Sign-On, SSL/HTTPS/HSTS, required 2FA, and logging and auditing at the application, web server, load balancing, database, and operating system layers.

Government Agencies interested in this technology can utilize their relationship with Modus to pursue these powerful tools in your eDiscovery objectives.\n**Discovery Production**\nAs electronically stored information has become more diverse and voluminous, the specificity and complexity of production formats has similarly increased. Today, productions may be required in a variety of formats, including native, PDF, and TIFF, with or without intricate load files, extracted text, and other features. Conforming, precisely and consistently, to mandated production specifications is an essential component of eDiscovery success.\nModus? production services include:\n* Native Production\n* PDF Production\n* TIFF Production\n* Hybrid Production\n* Custom Load File Creation\n* Slipsheet/Placeholder Generation\n* Endorsements and Bates Numbering\n**Data Collection and Forensics**\nThe collection of potentially relevant materials ? whether physically or electronically stored ? is a critical early step in the eDiscovery process. Successful execution of a collection requires the maintenance of both forensic soundness and the chain of custody from source to production, as well as the tools and experience to collect from today?s ever-multiplying range of sources. Modus? collection services include: * Evidence Identification\n* Data Harvesting & Forensic Collection\n* Forensic Imaging\n* Live & Targeted Data Acquisitions\n* Preservation\n* Analysis\n**eDiscovery Processing**\nTo facilitate hosted review and production, all collected electronically stored information must be processed. Such materials can come in hundreds of different formats, with different properties, different metadata, and potentially, different nested content. Processing finds and expands nested content, captures and organizes metadata, and extracts and normalizes text for review and production. Modus processing services enable you to use our hosted review platform or your own. We?ve built processing templates for all of the leading ECA and review tools to ensure you get pristine loads and fast, accurate and consistent processing no matter which downstream tools you are using. And, we can quickly customize or build a new template to meet your requirements.

that is FedRAMP compliant and meets DoD PA SRG Level 5 controls while leveraging Cisco hardware, world-class Equinix facilities, and open-source technology to provide compute, storage, and network resources to Federal customers in a secure manner. Customers can engage resources in an a la carte, and ?pay for performance? model that allows them to know exactly what to expect ? It?s the technology you need, when you need it.\nAll infrastructure resources are managed and monitored through the KPS tool ?Zeus?, which is included within the boundaries of the CloudSeed system, and gives customers the ability to view and manage cloud resources across the full range of possible KPS cloud deployments ? Public, Federal Community, and Private - as well as across multiple CSPs (AWS, Azure, etc.) and on-premise virtualization technologies (ESXi, KVM, etc.). By providing customers this single pane of glass to both view and manage all of their infrastructure solutions, Zeus allows for true ?hybrid? cloud solutions that can combine pre-existing customer solutions with new cloud-based solutions. Zeus gives customers a truly \"holistic\" view into their infrastructure, and allows them to move workloads across solutions as-needed to address specific business requirements.\nThe technical architecture that makes up CloudSeed is also available via the KPS Public Cloud for both Federal and Commercial customers, as well as in private cloud deployments on a customer's premises or in KPS' FedRAMP compliant data center. This architecture providers cheap, efficient, and reliable clouds by abstracting the underlying physical hardware and automatically and instantly recognizing every piece of hardware that is plugged into the system as simply Compute, Storage, or Network resources. In other words, KPS customers are able to use their pre-existing equipment as the basis for their own private cloud deployment simply by connecting it to the system via ethernet or fiber cable. Through this technology, customers are able to instantiate an entire cloud from scratch in under 20 minutes while re-using many of the same technical controls implemented in Knight Point's Federal Cloud, giving them previously unparalleled flexibility in their cloud deployments.","sales_email":"","security_email":"help@getopenwater.com","website":"www.knightpoint.com","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Coalfire-Systems-Inc- filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2100740435","name":"Tango","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/AgilQuest%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Tango Reserve by AgilQuest (Formerly Forum)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":9,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2021-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"#N/A","fedramp_auth":"2021-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"2022-09-16T04:00:00.000Z","independent_assessor":"Moss Adams","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"LI-SaaS","leveraged_systems":[],"agency_authorizations":["22-005-01","22-014-02","22-045","Department of Agriculture","Department of State","FHFA Office of the Inspector General","Health Resources and Services Administration","Millennium Challenge Corporation","National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"","sales_email":"","security_email":"info@knightpoint.com","website":"","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":[""],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-LI-SaaS filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Public-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Moss-Adams filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-"},{"id":"FR2029331613","name":"Informatica LLC","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/Informatica%20Logo.png","service_offering":"Informatica Intelligent Cloud Services (IICS)","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":2,"reuse":2,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2022-02-02T05:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"#N/A","fedramp_auth":"2022-02-02T05:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"2022-10-08T04:00:00.000Z","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["IaaS"],"deployment_model":"Public Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","leveraged_systems":[{"id":"FR2102577114","csp":"Pitney Bowes","cso":"SendPro 360","status":"FedRAMP Authorized"},{"id":"FR2102577114","csp":"Pitney Bowes","cso":"SendPro 360","status":"FedRAMP Authorized"},{"id":"FR2102577114","csp":"Pitney Bowes","cso":"SendPro 360","status":"FedRAMP Authorized"}],"agency_authorizations":["22-042","Department of Labor"],"agency_reuse":["22-025","Department of Agriculture"],"service_desc":"Government agencies need a better, faster, more reliable approach to integrate and deliver timely data and analytics to users and business systems that rely on data.

By moving security to a globally distributed cloud, Zscaler brings the Internet gateway closer to the user for a faster experience. Organizations can easily scale protection to all offices or users, regardless of location, and minimize network and appliance infrastructure.\n\n**The Cloud and Mobility Have Broken Perimeter Security**\n\nThe data center used to be the center of gravity. When applications resided there, it made sense to backhaul traffic from branch offices over a hub-and-spoke network. As traffic patterns shifted to the Internet, gateways were built with stacks of security appliances to allow secure Internet access. These gateways were also centralized to minimize the cost and complexity of securing multiple locations.\nHowever, as applications have moved to the cloud, the center of gravity has moved with it. User traffic often goes straight to the cloud, bypassing the security perimeter. Additionally, today?s complex threats have triggered an explosion of new security appliances, all finding their way into your overworked gateway. Administrators are in a constant battle to keep up with required security updates for their appliances. The complexity of deploying and managing all these appliances ? and their associated costs ? are out of control. Furthermore, it?s all associated with what is now an outdated architecture.\n\n**Zscaler Internet Access**\n\nZscaler Internet Access is a secure Internet and web gateway delivered as a service from the cloud. Think of it as a secure Internet onramp ? all you do is make Zscaler your next hop to the Internet. For offices, simply set up a router tunnel (GRE or IPsec) to the closest Zscaler data center. For mobile employees, you can forward traffic via our lightweight Zscaler App or PAC file. No matter where users connect ? a coffee shop in Milan, a hotel in Hong Kong, or the office ? they get identical protection.\n\nZscaler Internet Access sits between your users and the Internet, inspecting every byte of traffic inline across multiple security techniques, even within SSL. You get full protection from web and Internet threats. And with a cloud platform that supports Cloud Sandboxing, Next-Generation Firewall, Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and Cloud Application Visibility and Control, you can start with the services you need today and activate others as your needs grow.\n\nAll these capabilities are delivered from the Zscaler Cloud Security Platform, the world?s largest security cloud, which processes more than 30 billion requests a day. With over 100 patents, the Zscaler platform has been architected from the ground up as a truly distributed, multi-tenant cloud with enterprise performance and scale.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@gordian.com","website":"www.zscaler.com","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Data Management","Legal & Policy","Network Management","Operations Management"],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-High filter-auth-type-JAB filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Data-Management filter-business-function-Legal-Policy filter-business-function-Network-Management filter-business-function-Operations-Management"},{"id":"FR2131553959","name":"PC Matic","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/PC%20Matic%20Logo.png","service_offering":"PC Matic Federal Support System","status":"FedRAMP Authorized","authorization":1,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"Not Agency Partnered","ip_pmo_status":"Not Active","ip_pmo_date":"Not In Process","auth_date":"2022-07-05T04:00:00.000Z","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"#N/A","fedramp_auth":"2022-07-05T04:00:00.000Z","annual_assessment":"2022-03-10T05:00:00.000Z","independent_assessor":"Schellman Compliance, LLC","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Hybrid Cloud","impact_level":"Moderate","leveraged_systems":[{"id":"FR2102652499","csp":"RSA","cso":"RSA SecurID?

Zscaler Private Access builds from the same cloud-based, elastically scalable infrastructure to deliver seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets. Zscaler Private Access solves the challenges posed by a traditional VPN infrastructure by decoupling your internal assets and applications from the limitations, cost, and complexity of direct IP network connections. Zscaler Private Access delivers seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, the data center, or both. Policy-driven access adjusts dynamically to network changes, enabling enterprise agility while improving user experience. With Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant. Users no longer need to go through a termination appliance in the data center to get to apps in the cloud. In fact, there is no hardware to buy at all, because Zscaler Private Access, like our Cloud Security Platform, functions as a service. Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, freeing both your IT team and your budget even as we reduce latency and boost scalability. Zscaler Private Access is tied directly to your existing authentication infrastructure, leveraging single sign-on to further reduce complexity. The result is that unlike traditional, network-based remote access solutions, Zscaler Private Access can be deployed in a matter of hours instead of taking weeks or months.\n**Improve your security posture even as you provide seamless access** The reductions in overall cost and complexity are compelling on their own, but the paramount feature of the Zscaler Private Access solution is security. Once a connection is established between the asset and the client, the traffic traversing the solution remains completely isolated; because Zscaler Private Access is built on the premise of zero trust for your private applications, the traffic is isolated from us, as well. And because Zscaler Private Access abstracts the asset from the network, it not only ensures seamless access regardless of physical location, it dramatically increases your overall security posture by effectively making your most sensitive material invisible. Any attempt to route back to the application/asset meets a dead end.\n**Connect by application, not by IP address** VPNs have been designed to deliver access to a network, not to an application. Once on a network, malware can propagate, and users may be able to get access to adjacent applications from which they should be restricted. In addition, because VPN concentrators must listen for inbound connection attempts, they present an attack surface which may be exploited by such things as Distributed Denial of Service attacks. Eliminate the cost of VPNs and associated equipment As part of our global, cloud-based security platform, Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, which frees both your IT staff and your budget and enables deployment in a matter of hours. Even better, Zscaler Private Access is deployed via the same Zscaler App you use to access our cloud security platform, which greatly reduces your ?client sprawl? by delivering a single app that provisions Zscaler Remote Access, Secure Web Gateway, Data Loss Prevention, Cloud Sandboxing, Cloud Firewall, and more. Take your applications from ?on-net? to ?dark- net,? at the same time YOU get complete visibility. Zscaler Private Access renders your applications invisible to all but authorized users, and unrouteable to anyone. But because the solution works at the application layer, we also deliver a level of visibility to you that has never been possible. Once you provision a Connector in front of a bank of assets, you can use a wildcard attribute to discover exactly what applications are running there. Some customers have found almost ten times as many applications in use as they had expected! And once you know what applications are running, you can easily create granular access rules for them. App Discovery makes deployment easy.","sales_email":"","security_email":"fedramp@1901group.com","website":"www.zscaler.com","uei":"","small_business":"No","business_function":["Cybersecurity & Risk Management","Legal & Policy","Network Management","Virtual Private Network (VPN)"],"service_last_90":["#N/A"],"all_others":["#N/A"],"filter_classes":" filter-status-FedRAMP-Authorized filter-impact-level-Moderate filter-auth-type-Agency filter-deployment-model-Government-Community-Cloud filter-small-business-No filter-assessor-Schellman-Compliance-LLC filter-service-model-SaaS filter-business-function-Cybersecurity-Risk-Management filter-business-function-Legal-Policy filter-business-function-Network-Management filter-business-function-Virtual-Private-Network-VPN-"},{"id":"F1305012100A","name":"1901 Group","logo":"https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/img/logos/CSP_logos/1901%20Logo.png","service_offering":"in3sight High","status":"FedRAMP In Process","authorization":0,"reuse":0,"ready_status":"Not Active","ready_date":"No FRR Date","ip_jab_status":"Not Active","ip_jab_date":"Not Active","ip_agency_status":"Not Active","ip_agency_date":"2022-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_status":"2022-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","ip_pmo_date":"2022-08-01T04:00:00.000Z","auth_date":"Not Authorized","auth_type":"Agency","fedramp_ready":"No FRR Date","partnering_agency":"#N/A","fedramp_auth":"Not Authorized","annual_assessment":"#N/A","independent_assessor":"Coalfire Systems, Inc.","service_model":["SaaS"],"deployment_model":"Hybrid Cloud","impact_level":"High","leveraged_systems":[{"id":"FR2113157410","csp":"Public Health Foundation","cso":"TRAIN Learning Network","status":"FedRAMP Authorized"},{"id":"FR2113157410","csp":"Public Health Foundation","cso":"TRAIN Learning Network","status":"FedRAMP Authorized"},{"id":"FR2113157410","csp":"Public Health Foundation","cso":"TRAIN Learning Network","status":"FedRAMP Authorized"}],"agency_authorizations":["#N/A"],"agency_reuse":["#N/A"],"service_desc":"1901 Group?s in3sight is a consumption-based as-a-service cloud delivery capability providing Information Technology (IT) managed services for federal customer environments that span cloud, customer site, and hybrid configurations. in3sight is inclusive of 1901 Group?s 24?7 Operations Center in Blacksburg, Virginia where their software as a service (SaaS) platform is used to monitor, manage, and optimize enterprise IT environments.

EIT specializes in delivering cost conscious, innovative solutions to meet the evolving business requirements of the clients we serve. As a Type C FedRAMP accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), EIT is authorized to conduct independent security risk assessments for Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and deliver FedRAMP consulting services. EIT?s 3PAO services provide multiple levels of security assessment for CSP?s looking to comply with FedRAMP and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. While many CSP?s set out to and achieve an Authority To Operate (ATO), others simply want to be held to the highest standard. With over 1,000 federal assessments based on NIST controls, EIT is ready to support your needs. We offer Gap Assessments, FedRAMP Assessments, Readiness Assessments, Turn-key SSP Documentation and Consulting, Penetration Testing, and Threat Hunting.\n\n**FedRAMP Readiness Assessment / Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)**\n\nSome organizations may opt to pursue a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment to help market their platform and attract an agency sponsor. This step toward your eventual FedRAMP authorization does not require a full penetration test, but you must still demonstrate a level of maturity aligned with the FedRAMP security framework. EIT can quickly support this FedRAMP stage with a four-week assessment timeline that may lead to your ?FedRAMP Ready? designation on the FedRAMP Marketplace.\n\n**FedRAMP Assessment & Attestation**\n\nAs a FedRAMP 3PAO, EIT has performed thousands of security assessments across the federal and commercial landscape. Because EIT has been on both sides of the process, we believe advisors make the best assessors. Our subject matter experts are not solely focused on checklists. They understand which findings are real, rather than false flags that disrupt and slow down the assessment process. Working with EIT means you are mitigating risk and maintaining the agreed-upon timelines. Through the FedRAMP assessment process, EIT will develop the required documentation, including a Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM) to document assessment results, Security Assessment Report (SAR), and recommendation for authorization.\n\n**FedRAMP Advisory & Remediation**\n\nAre you transitioning to a new FIPS-199 designation, requiring you to comply with more controls? Are you thinking about implementing a multi-cloud deployment strategy? Are you trying to find ways to leverage your current compliance and security investments to help you achieve your FedRAMP authorization? Working collaboratively with your teams, we will identify, understand, and help you overcome your unique FedRAMP compliance challenges as we walk you through your FedRAMP preparation. With the gap assessment in-hand, EIT will work with your team to map out and engineer the ideal system architecture and to document the necessary environment and security practices within your custom-tailored System Security Plan (SSP). Our advisory services can encompass various CSP systems and service models to ensure that timelines are defined and met, deficiencies in system architecture and policies are mended, understanding of FedRAMP controls and procedures is achieved, annual audits and ATO renewal process is smooth with dedicated continuous monitoring.\n\n**Gap Assessment**\n\nThe first step in the certification process is to determine your organization?s readiness. How confident are you that you can move forward with your FedRAMP goals? Do you meet the FedRAMP showstoppers and critical controls? EIT will work with your team to identify how FedRAMP requirements may impact your organization?s operations and security architecture. These discovery activities are led by EIT?s subject matter experts through hands-on workshops and interviews with key personnel in your organization, culminating in a final report that describes critical gaps and prescribes recommendations for remediation.\n\n**FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (ConMonaaS)**\n\nMaintaining documentation and systems that are outmoded but still essential can command more resources than most organizations can sustain. FedRAMP is a continuous program, rather than just a project with a start and end date. The EIT team will establish and assist with the monthly, quarterly, and annual continuous monitoring activities and reports required to maintain your authority to operate. This offering can be integrated with your organization?s many compliance requirements, such as CMMC, FISMA, HITRUST, ISO, and more.","services":"Emagine IT provides expert advisory services that grant Cloud Service Providers everything that is needed to pass assessments and obtain/renew their ATOs.

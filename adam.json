Zscaler Private Access builds from the same cloud-based, elastically scalable infrastructure to deliver seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets.\nZscaler Private Access solves the challenges posed by a traditional VPN infrastructure by decoupling your internal assets and applications from the limitations, cost, and complexity of direct IP network connections. Zscaler Private Access delivers seamless connectivity to private internal applications and assets whether they are in the cloud, the data center, or both. Policy-driven access adjusts dynamically to network changes, enabling enterprise agility while improving user experience.\nWith Zscaler Private Access, there is no need to provision VPN termination hardware, or to ensure that such a deployment is globally distributed and redundant. Users no longer need to go through a termination appliance in the data center to get to apps in the cloud. In fact, there is no hardware to buy at all, because Zscaler Private Access, like our Cloud Security Platform, functions as a service.\nZscaler maintains all hardware and software, freeing both your IT team and your budget even as we reduce latency and boost scalability. Zscaler Private Access is tied directly to your existing authentication infrastructure, leveraging single sign-on to further reduce complexity. The result is that unlike traditional, network-based remote access solutions, Zscaler Private Access can be deployed in a matter of hours instead of taking weeks or months.\n**Improve your security posture even as you provide seamless access**\nThe reductions in overall cost and complexity are compelling on their own, but the paramount feature of the Zscaler Private Access solution is security. Once a connection is established between the asset and the client, the traffic traversing the solution remains completely isolated; because Zscaler Private Access is built on the premise of zero trust for your private applications, the traffic is isolated from us, as well. And because Zscaler Private Access abstracts the asset from the network, it not only ensures seamless access regardless of physical location, it dramatically increases your overall security posture by effectively making your most sensitive material invisible. Any attempt to route back to the application/asset meets a dead end.\n**Connect by application, not by IP address**\nVPNs have been designed to deliver access to a network, not to an application. Once on a network, malware can propagate and users may be able to get access to adjacent applications from which they should be restricted. In addition, because VPN concentrators must listen for inbound connection attempts, they present an attack surface which may be exploited by such things as Distributed Denial of Service attacks.\nEliminate the cost of VPNs and associated equipment\nAs part of our global, cloud-based security platform, Zscaler maintains all hardware and software, which frees both your IT staff and your budget and enables deployment in a matter of hours. Even better, Zscaler Private Access is deployed via the same Zscaler App you use to access our cloud security platform, which greatly reduces your ?client sprawl? by delivering a\nsingle app that provisions Zscaler Remote Access, Secure Web Gateway, Data Loss Prevention, Cloud Sandboxing, Cloud Firewall, and more.\nTake your applications from ?on-net? to ?dark- net,? at the same time YOU get complete visibility. Zscaler Private Access renders your applications invisible to all but authorized users, and unroutable to anyone. But because the solution works at the application layer, we also deliver a level of visibility to you that has never before been possible. Once you provision a Connector in front of a bank of assets, you can use a wildcard attribute to discover exactly what applications are actually running there. Some customers have found almost ten times as many applications in use as they had expected!

For CSP's new to FedRAMP, our team begins the engagement with a technical architecture and engineering review, and a gap analysis of the most critical controls. A report is generated with specific recommendation to empower the CSP's technical and/or engineering team(s) to begin remediations. Our team will then begin to build out the FedRAMP package which includes all required documentation, as well as the development of FedRAMP compliant processes. As a part of the FedRAMP journey, our team works with all relevant stakeholders to educate the team on new process requirements to ensure the CSP becomes compliant and remains compliant after authorization.

EIT specializes in delivering cost conscious, innovative solutions to meet the evolving business requirements of the clients we serve. As a Type C FedRAMP accredited Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO), EIT is authorized to conduct independent security risk assessments for Cloud Service Providers (CSP) and deliver FedRAMP consulting services. EIT?s 3PAO services provide multiple levels of security assessment for CSP?s looking to comply with FedRAMP and Department of Defense (DoD) requirements. While many CSP?s set out to and achieve an Authority To Operate (ATO), others simply want to be held to the highest standard. With over 1,000 federal assessments based on NIST controls, EIT is ready to support your needs. We offer Gap Assessments, FedRAMP Assessments, Readiness Assessments, Turn-key SSP Documentation and Consulting, Penetration Testing, and Threat Hunting.\n\n**FedRAMP Readiness Assessment / Readiness Assessment Report (RAR)**\n\nSome organizations may opt to pursue a FedRAMP Readiness Assessment to help market their platform and attract an agency sponsor. This step toward your eventual FedRAMP authorization does not require a full penetration test, but you must still demonstrate a level of maturity aligned with the FedRAMP security framework. EIT can quickly support this FedRAMP stage with a four-week assessment timeline that may lead to your ?FedRAMP Ready? designation on the FedRAMP Marketplace.\n\n**FedRAMP Assessment & Attestation**\n\nAs a FedRAMP 3PAO, EIT has performed thousands of security assessments across the federal and commercial landscape. Because EIT has been on both sides of the process, we believe advisors make the best assessors. Our subject matter experts are not solely focused on checklists. They understand which findings are real, rather than false flags that disrupt and slow down the assessment process. Working with EIT means you are mitigating risk and maintaining the agreed-upon timelines. Through the FedRAMP assessment process, EIT will develop the required documentation, including a Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Requirements Traceability Matrix (SRTM) to document assessment results, Security Assessment Report (SAR), and recommendation for authorization.\n\n**FedRAMP Advisory & Remediation**\n\nAre you transitioning to a new FIPS-199 designation, requiring you to comply with more controls? Are you thinking about implementing a multi-cloud deployment strategy? Are you trying to find ways to leverage your current compliance and security investments to help you achieve your FedRAMP authorization? Working collaboratively with your teams, we will identify, understand, and help you overcome your unique FedRAMP compliance challenges as we walk you through your FedRAMP preparation. With the gap assessment in-hand, EIT will work with your team to map out and engineer the ideal system architecture and to document the necessary environment and security practices within your custom-tailored System Security Plan (SSP). Our advisory services can encompass various CSP systems and service models to ensure that timelines are defined and met, deficiencies in system architecture and policies are mended, understanding of FedRAMP controls and procedures is achieved, annual audits and ATO renewal process is smooth with dedicated continuous monitoring.\n\n**Gap Assessment**\n\nThe first step in the certification process is to determine your organization?s readiness. How confident are you that you can move forward with your FedRAMP goals? Do you meet the FedRAMP showstoppers and critical controls? EIT will work with your team to identify how FedRAMP requirements may impact your organization?s operations and security architecture. These discovery activities are led by EIT?s subject matter experts through hands-on workshops and interviews with key personnel in your organization, culminating in a final report that describes critical gaps and prescribes recommendations for remediation.\n\n**FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (ConMonaaS)**\n\nMaintaining documentation and systems that are outmoded but still essential can command more resources than most organizations can sustain. FedRAMP is a continuous program, rather than just a project with a start and end date. The EIT team will establish and assist with the monthly, quarterly, and annual continuous monitoring activities and reports required to maintain your authority to operate.
